# Facial_Age_Classifier


* Implemented Deep learning and transfer learning for facial age classification of ~20K different images segmented in 3 age ranges.
* The data had some level of imbalance in the three classes with ‘Middle’ age being the most populous. So, used stratified splitting to overcome class imbalance to a certain extent.
* Dropped the sizes of images to 150, as the process was computationally extensive.
* Achieved train and test accuracy of 89% and 87% respectively leveraging 2 dense layers CNN model incorporated with Dropout and Batch normalization layers.
